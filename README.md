# WhatsApp OSINT Tool

Welcome to the first WhatsApp OSINT tool. This was developed in early 2019 but I decided to restart the project now for fun. 

# How to Use

First, install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- You will need chromedriver, or you can modify the code and use GeckoDriver or any other drivers for Selenium.
- You will need a GUI to execute the code since it interacts with web.whatsapp.com to get statuses
- Replace the name in the file with whichever name you want to track
